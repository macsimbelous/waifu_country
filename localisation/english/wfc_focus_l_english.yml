 wfc_smb_army_academy: "Expand the Army Academy"
 wfc_smb_army_academy_desc: "Having effective weapons is not the only factor that determines the outcome of a battle. Another huge factor is the skill of not only the individual soldier, but also that of the general commanding the troops. To reach this end, we should invest in expanding the operations of the army department of our military academy."
 wfc_smb_regular_infantry: "The Strength of the Common Soldier"
 wfc_smb_regular_infantry_desc: "Though equipment is as important than anything else, it is the individual soldier, defending his homeland, protecting his core values, and fighting for his loved ones, who is the real strength of any army. That is why we must to our fullest to increase the morale of the common soldier, and give him the best chances of winning his toughest battles."
 wfc_smb_artillery: "Specializing the Heavy Guns Industries"
 wfc_smb_artillery_desc: "Our economy isn't as strong as the major powers such as Britain, France and Italy. As such we will need to specialize the heavy guns production if we want stronger and better equipment, even though we wish that we had the money to pay for all our desired equipment."
 wfc_smb_foreign_designs: "Acquiring Foreign Designs"
 wfc_smb_foreign_designs_desc: "Even though we wish that we had the scientists and engineers to make our own armor, it is best if we instead use the connections we possess to wrangle ourselves some good deals on the international market, as it is the only real and viable option for acquiring specialized equipment at the current moment in time."
 wfc_smb_foreign_advisors: "Foreign Advisors"
 wfc_smb_foreign_advisors_desc: "Though the [ROOT.GetAdj] military instructors are good, they are not as good as those who have fought in multiple conflicts, and been trained in military academies of highest prestige in other countries.

 wfc_smb_army_professionalism: "Further Increase Army Professionalism"
 wfc_smb_army_professionalism_desc: "Though it may be good practice to have as many soldiers as possible standing by in wait to join the army, it is, according to our foreign military advisors, much more important to make sure that the army actually performs at top condition during any moment in time."
 wfc_smb_conscription: "Increase Conscription"
 wfc_smb_conscription_desc: "Though the professionalism of our solders could perhaps be questioned, it is without doubt that what our army currently needs desperately is more soldiers to fill out the ranks, as we are suffering from a lack of men willing to join our armed forces."
 wfc_smb_experimental_weapons_department: "An Experimental Weapons Department"
 wfc_smb_experimental_weapons_department_desc: "If we wish to not fall behind our rivals in the technical department, it would be best if we started theorizing about and attempting to develop so called wonder weapons, so that we don't get outclassed on the battlefield."
 wfc_smb_nuclear_program: "A Domestic Nuclear Program"

 wfc_smb_special_forces: "Special Forces Programs"
 wfc_smb_special_forces_desc: "Our army, though small, could be strengthened massively by utilizing specially trained soldiers, who excel at certain situations and battle-types. Thus, establishing programs for training and harboring such soldiers should be considered our number one priority."
 wfc_smb_special_forces_option_1: "Strengthen the Mountain Regiments"
 wfc_smb_special_forces_option_1_desc: "The Mountaineers of the army should receive our upper command's special attention, as they perform feats that our regular troops could only wish of ever performing. They enable to perform combat in the treacherous Andes, and can support our regulars when pushing forward."
 wfc_smb_special_forces_option_2: "A Strong Marine Force"
 wfc_smb_special_forces_option_2_desc: "As the navy is one of our current strong points, it would be more than beneficial to utilize the fact and allow them to possess their own military branch, consisting of gruelingly trained and extremely effective marines."
 wfc_smb_special_forces_option_3: "Expand the Airforce Army Branch"
 wfc_smb_special_forces_option_3_desc: "As the air force is one of our current strong points, it would be more than beneficial to utilize the fact and allow them to possess their own military branch, consisting of specially trained and extremely effective paratroopers."
 wfc_smb_special_forces_option_1_continuation: "Ranger Training Programs"
 wfc_smb_special_forces_option_1_continuation_desc: "To support our mountaineers we should employ Rangers, soldiers specially trained in attacking and scouting in not only the vicinity of the mountains, but also in the forests and jungles of South America."

 wfc_smb_special_forces_option_2_continuation_desc: "In order for our Marines to function at full capacity and effectiveness, we should consider developing technologies that support them, such as landing vehicles and better supply distribution techniques for when landing on the shores."
 wfc_smb_special_forces_option_3_continuation: "Supporting Aerial Landings"
 wfc_smb_special_forces_option_3_continuation_desc: "In order for our Paratroopers to have the highest possible chance of success when performing the jumps, we should consider developing technologies that help increase their survivability, be it droppable armor or camouflaged supply crates."
 wfc_smb_air_defense: "Air Defense"
 wfc_smb_air_defense_desc: "Now that our rivals have shown their true colors and started developing their own aerial weapons, we must prepare our response. As such, we should start by ordering the rapid construction and deployment of anti air emplacements and guns." 
 wfc_smb_air_force: "Air Force"
 wfc_smb_air_force_desc: "Many theorists would argue that the area we are currently falling behind in most is the development of a modern air force. Therefore, we must work hard to remedy this, by constructing new hangar and facilities, as well as training additional pilots."
 wfc_smb_air_academy: "Establish a Proper Air Academy"
 wfc_smb_air_academy_desc: "It is not only the soldiers who will fight in the ground forces who need to be properly taught. Our pilots, though enthusiastic, lack the professional training they need to excel in dogfights. To solve this, we should expand the military academy to include more classes catering to the air force."
 wfc_smb_construct_air_bases: "Construct New Air Bases"
 wfc_smb_construct_air_bases_desc: "Besides needing professional and well educated and motivated pilots, we also lack another critical function required for a large air force, airfields. Though we have a few, they are not enough for if we wish to expand the air force to a level where it can become competitive."
 wfc_smb_domestic_designs: "Domestic Designs"
 wfc_smb_domestic_designs_desc: "It would be best to create and produce our own models and plane designs, as other countries cannot be deemed trustworthy of either designing or producing airplanes fit for our pilots."
 wfc_smb_license_designs: "License Foreign Designs"
 wfc_smb_license_designs_desc: "It takes too much time and effort to research and develop our own design for airplanes. That is why we should instead license foreign equipment, and instead just focus on producing it here in [ROOT.GetNameDef]."
 wfc_smb_purchase_aircraft: "Purchase Foreign Aircraft"
 wfc_smb_purchase_aircraft_desc: "Our air force has decided that it would be much too costly and time consuming to not only develop, but also produce our own planes. They are instead advocating the purchasing of foreign equipment, and stance we should take as well."
 wfc_smb_establish_aircraft_industry: "A Domestic Aircraft Industry"
 wfc_smb_establish_aircraft_industry_desc: "It is clear that if we wish to keep our production efficiency as high as possible, we must establish a large scale aircraft industry within our own borders."
 wfc_smb_flying_fortress: "Flying Fortresses"
 wfc_smb_flying_fortress_desc: "The only way to properly utilize an air force is to use it to bomb the enemy into submission, until there is nothing left standing in front of the horizon. We should therefore construct large airplanes, with the capability of carrying as much explosives as we could possibly ever need."
 wfc_smb_tactical_air_force: "A Tactical Air Force"
 wfc_smb_tactical_air_force_desc: "The air force should be used to not only support the ground forces, but to perform a multitude of more complex tasks, ones which the ground forces alone cannot do. That is the true essence of what makes an air force great."
 wfc_smb_nimble_air_force: "A Nimble Air Force"
 wfc_smb_nimble_air_force_desc: "Planes should be able to outmaneuver not only the enemy planes, but also the watching eyes of their anti air guns and naval vessels. And air force should consist of smaller planes, fitted to perform dog-fighting and strikes in an efficient enough manner, while never becoming to heavy to maneuver quickly and decisively."
 wfc_smb_strategic_bombing: "Focus on Strategic Bombing"
 wfc_smb_strategic_bombing_desc: "You win a war by defeating the enemy not only in combat, but also by crippling their economy and industrial capabilities. That is why strategic bombing should be considered our number one objective during war."
 wfc_smb_army_support: "Army Support"
 wfc_smb_army_support_desc: "The army cannot win if being actively struck from the sky. That is why, while not only using our air-force to defend them against such action, the planes should also be heavily geared towards doing the same against our opponents."
 wfc_smb_winning_the_air_war: "Winning the Air War"
 wfc_smb_winning_the_air_war_desc: "While ground support and naval bombing can all be considered important, it is very necessary to realize that without control of the skies, these actions are all worth nothing. Therefore, our air-force should be geared towards controlling the skies as much as possible."
 wfc_smb_naval_support: "Focus on Naval Support"
 wfc_smb_naval_support_desc: "Our planes number one objective is to help us clear the way for and protect our navies and civilian convoys. It is therefore important to design the planes with the role of naval support and patrol in mind, and make sure that they can avoid being shot down by on-board anti-air cannons."
 wfc_smb_air_modifier_boost_1: "Ground Support Specialization"
 wfc_smb_air_modifier_boost_1_desc: "It is very important to make sure that the infantry can always get to where they are going, and for that reason it is also important to focus the air force on helping them do so, be it from direct air support, or from bombing behind the enemy's lines."
 wfc_smb_air_modifier_boost_2: "Developing Advanced Airframes"
 wfc_smb_air_modifier_boost_2_desc: "If we wish for our planes to survive contact with the enemy, it is important that they are not only able to avoid as many hits as possible, but that they can also survive a hit or two, and reach as far as they need to go to get back for repairs. That is why we should develop better frames and engines for our planes, so that the pilots can be safe, no matter what."
 wfc_smb_air_doctrine: "Doctrinal Advancements"
 wfc_smb_air_doctrine_desc: "It is important to note that without a proper strategy, not even the greatest pilots and planes can thrive in battle. Wars are all about planning, strategies and using the individual strengths of the nation to their fullest. We should thus dedicate great effort to developing new doctrines for our air force to follow."
 wfc_smb_aircraft_carriers: "Aircraft Carriers"
 wfc_smb_joint_operative_command: "Joint Operations Command"
 wfc_smb_joint_operative_command_desc: "Now that we have developed not only our army, but also established good grounds for our air force, it is time to establish creating coordination and cooperation between these different army branches. As such, we will found a join operative command, consisting of commanders selected from both fields."
 wfc_smb_war_planning_office: "War Planning Office"
 wfc_smb_war_planning_office_desc: "We also need to now make sure that our army can receive proper and well thought out plans and orders, as to not fall behind in the information war and happen to get outdated details that lead to them being ambushed and destroyed. As such, we should found a war planning office, to better coordinate these efforts."

We are a people used to living in the mountains, and we will use our expertise to defeat any juggernaut we come up against."

 wfc_smb_navy_desc: "Our navy has stagnated since the Great War to such an extent that many of our vessels are no longer fit for purpose. It is time we invested in the fleet and begin a massive modernization program."
 wfc_smb_CHL_navy_desc: "While our fleet has a long and proud tradition, the Navy's prestige was badly damaged by the naval mutiny of 1931. By investing in the Armada de Chile we can help rebuild public confidence in our Navy."
 wfc_smb_naval_academy_desc: "Simply producing and maintaining ships is not enough to constitute a navy. We require officers and specialists who are highly trained in how to utilize naval assets in a battle. Therefore, we shall establish a [ROOT.GetAdjective] naval academy to train the next generation of naval officers."
 wfc_smb_construct_naval_bases_desc: "Our naval facilities are antiquated and in desperate need of modernization. By investing in such facilities, we will be able to construct and support much more capable naval assets."
 wfc_smb_naval_foreign_advisors_desc: "Our naval officers have had little opportunity to test their capabilities in battle recently. We could therefore benefit from inviting officers from foreign navies to train our own officers in modern naval tactics."
 wfc_smb_reescalate_the_naval_arms_race_desc: "While we have no formal agreement with our neighbors over the size of our navies, we have refrained from expanding them too much since the Great War. However, war is on the horizon once again and it would be better for us to have a headstart on rearmament over our neighbors. "
 wfc_smb_blue_water_fleet_desc: "Projection of naval power is critical to any nation that aspires to join the ranks of the great powers or to maintain a strong deterrent against would-be foes. We should therefore ensure our navy has the right equipment and training to operate effectively even when far from home ports."
 wfc_smb_coastal_fleet_desc: "We have little aspiration for fighting in battle across the globe. The primary objective of our fleet should therefore be to protect our coastlines and prevent any foe from landing forces upon our shores."
 wfc_smb_purchase_cruisers_and_dreadnoughts_desc: "While our industrial strength continues to grow, time is not on our side. In order to adequately strengthen our navy, we need more capital ships as soon as possible. Therefore, we shall reach out to the great powers to see if they are willing to sell their mothballed dreadnoughts and cruisers."
 wfc_smb_minelaying_desc: "Maintaining enough ships to defend our vast coastline at all times can be prohibitively expensive. Mines offer a cheaper solution that can help deter or slow down enemy forces until the fleet arrives."
 wfc_smb_escort_fleet_desc: "The days of grand battle fleets are over, modern naval warfare requires fleets of smaller vessels in escort formations alongside a limited number of capital ships. The navy therefore needs to reorientate their plans to accommodate such tactics. "
 wfc_smb_raiding_fleet_desc: "Naval supply lines are crucial to the functioning of most economies. Using our naval assets to disrupt those supply lines could be a way to bring even the most powerful nations to their knees."
 wfc_smb_degaussing_desc: "We will start to degauss our ship hulls, reducing their magnetic signature. This protects them from magnetic mines and reduces the ships’ electronic profile."
 wfc_smb_naval_invasion_desc: "Dealing with an enemy nation often requires soldiers landing on their shores. In order to maximize our ability to carry out such operations, we shall begin training the army and navy in joint exercises. "
 wfc_smb_cruiser_subs_desc: "The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are vast and require submarines that can operate efficiently on their own for extended periods of time. We therefore need to invest in developing our own cruiser submarines."
 wfc_smb_midget_subs_desc: "Operating self-supporting submarines in the vast oceans would be a fruitless endeavor. We can make better use of our resources by constructing smaller vessels that operate in the shallower waters of our coastline."
 wfc_smb_expand_repair_yards_desc: "Even the most robust ships with the most efficient crews will eventually need repairs before returning to active duty. We should invest in our naval repair yards to ensure the process is as rapid as possible. "
 wfc_smb_enlarge_naval_facilities_desc: "Recent developments across the globe have it clear that our navy must expand if we are to maintain an adequate fleet. The first step towards doing so is expanding our existing naval facilities."
 wfc_smb_merchant_marine_desc: "The transport of resources over sea is vital to the national security of many nations, ours being no exception. Therefore, we should establish a professional merchant marine fleet capable of supporting our military in times of crisis."
 wfc_smb_aircraft_carriers_desc: "To avoid being left behind by our foes, we need to incorporate aircraft into our navy. In order to do so, we need to produce aircraft carriers of our own. Utilizing the hulls of our larger, outdated ships may be a way to accelerate production of them."
 wfc_smb_fortification_effort_desc: "While the navy and airforce are our primary means of preventing enemy forces from reaching our shores, we should still maintain a robust series of coastal fortifications as a final line of defense against any would be invader."

 wfc_smb_jungle_warfare_training: "Establish CIGS"
 wfc_smb_jungle_warfare_training_desc: "A number of our military officers have urged us to invest in the establishment of a specialized training facility in the Amazon. The objective for the facility will be to prepare our troops for unconventional warfare in the jungle and promoting the use of the terrain as an ally during combat."
 wfc_smb_brown_water_navy: "Brown Water Navy"
 wfc_smb_brown_water_navy_desc: "The rivers that weave through the jungles of South America are not being adequately utilized by our military. We shall expand our brown water fleet with a number of small river attack boats to aid in the support of our soldiers when they are far from reinforcements or supply."

 wfc_smb_carrier_conversion: "Converted Aircraft Carriers"
 wfc_smb_carrier_conversion_desc: "Our naval air power is insufficient to defend our national interests. While we can not afford to build purpose built carriers, we could purchase decomissioned crusiers and convert them to simple carriers as a stop-gap measure."
